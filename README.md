Un-Requesting sent requested on #instagram is a tedious task for every creator. ü•±
So, I wrote a #python script to do so. Just give your login credentials and it will automatically scrap all users and unrequest/unfollow them one by one.

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è This is not acceptable by instagram. Your account may got suspended.
However I tried to mimic human behaviour as close as possible.

I am using it regularly without being caught. Do it for 20-30 users at a time only and you are safe.

Library used:
```
- selenium
```

`!pip install selenium`

# How to use.

Replace 'Your-Username' and 'Your-Password' with yours login credentials in the super_secret python file. 

```python
Username = 'Your-Username'
Password = 'Your-Password'
```
Run the `instagram_bot.py` file to scrap users and unfollow them.
